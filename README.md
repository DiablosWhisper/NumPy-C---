# NumPy(C++)
It's my own version of NumPy. My realization of matrix multiplication is more then 3-4 times faster for C++ and 8 times faster for Python, then NumPy matmul() and dot(). Other functions are faster too, but not like a multiplication. This version of the library will be supported in the future. P.S. All tests were done on my computer, the results on your computers may vary.
